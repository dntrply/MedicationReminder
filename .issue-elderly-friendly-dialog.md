Summary
In the Timeline action dialog (Taken / Snooze / Skip), the medication image is visually small relative to the overall sheet and action area (per attached screenshot). For elderly patients, this reduces recognition and increases the chance of tap errors. We should redesign the dialog to make the medication image and the action choices large, high‑contrast, and easy to hit.

Current Behavior
- The image/avatar at the top of the dialog is relatively small.
- Action buttons (Taken, Snooze, Skip) do not occupy much vertical space and may be easy to mis‑tap, especially on small screens or with tremors/low vision.

Why This Matters
- Elderly users and users with visual/motor impairments rely on large, high‑contrast targets and clear hierarchy.
- Clear medication recognition (large image + name + time) helps avoid picking the wrong action for the wrong medication.

Proposed Solution
Layout and Sizing
- Make the medication image prominent: 120–160 dp square image at top (rounded corners), centered, with sufficient margin.
- Increase name and time typography: name 20–22 sp bold; time 18–20 sp medium/high contrast.
- Enlarge buttons (Material min target ≥ 48 dp):
  - “Taken”: full‑width prominent button, 56–64 dp height.
  - “Snooze” and “Skip”: side‑by‑side, each min 56 dp height, wide enough for comfortable tap, with generous spacing (≥ 8–12 dp).
- Maintain consistent padding (16–24 dp) so content breathes and scan path is clear.

Contrast and Semantics
- Use high‑contrast colors that meet WCAG 2.1 AA (≥ 4.5:1 for text on backgrounds).
- Keep color semantics consistent: green for “Taken”, orange/neutral for “Snooze”, red for “Skip”. Ensure text legibility on colored buttons.
- Add contentDescription to the image: include medication name for screen readers.

Error‑proofing and Clarity
- Optional: show a brief confirmation sheet/toast/snackbar for “Skip” to prevent accidental skipping (can be turned off after user familiarity).
- Disable/hide “Snooze” and “Skip” after an occurrence is already SKIPPED (see Issue #11) to avoid contradictory actions.

Accessibility and Touch Targets
- Ensure min touch targets 48x48 dp as per Material/Android accessibility.
- Provide TalkBack labels: “Taken”, “Snooze for N minutes”, “Skip dose”.
- Respect user font scaling; ensure dialog scales gracefully up to at least 1.5–2.0 font scale.

Implementation Notes
- Primary entry point: action dialog in TimelineView.
  - File: app/src/main/java/com/medreminder/app/ui/TimelineView.kt
  - Section: action dialog (around lines where “Taken”, “Snooze”, “Skip” buttons are created).
- If reusing the dialog elsewhere (e.g., TakeMedicationsScreen, OutstandingMedicationsScreen), apply the same sizing and accessibility conventions.
- Consider extracting a shared “MedicationActionDialogLarge” composable (with parameters for image/name/time and button callbacks) to reduce duplication.

Acceptance Criteria
- The medication image renders at least 120 dp (or device‑appropriate equivalent) and is visually dominant at the top of the dialog.
- Button heights ≥ 56 dp; all tap targets ≥ 48 dp; spacing ≥ 8–12 dp.
- Typography updated: name ≥ 20 sp bold, time ≥ 18 sp, good contrast.
- Actions are clearly differentiated and high‑contrast; TalkBack announces actions and medication name.
- Post‑skip state: “Snooze” and “Skip” disabled/hidden for the same occurrence (consistent with Issue #11).
- Verified to fit and remain legible at largest system font size.

Nice‑to‑Have (Optional)
- Haptic feedback on action buttons.
- Short fade/scale animation on image to draw focus when dialog opens.

Out of Scope
- Changing business logic for actions.
- Changing how overdue/pending logic is computed.
