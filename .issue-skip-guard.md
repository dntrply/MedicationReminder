Summary
In the Timeline action dialog (Taken / Snooze / Skip), if a dose has already been marked SKIPPED for a given medication at a specific scheduled hour:minute on the same day, the user can still press Snooze or Skip again. This allows duplicate or conflicting actions for the same occurrence.

Steps To Reproduce
- From Timeline, tap a medication at an already elapsed time (e.g., 09:42).
- In the action dialog, tap Skip. A SKIPPED entry is added to History, repeats are canceled, and pending entry removed.
- Tap the same medication/time again from Timeline.
- Observe: Snooze and Skip remain enabled; user can Snooze or Skip again for the same occurrence.

Expected Behavior
- Once a specific medication occurrence (same day + same scheduled hour:minute) is recorded as SKIPPED, the Snooze and Skip actions should be disabled or hidden for that occurrence.
- Optionally allow Taken to remain available if you want to permit correction (user actually took it after skipping). If not desired, Taken could also be disabled.

Actual Behavior
- Snooze and Skip remain enabled after SKIPPED has already been recorded for the same medication/time, allowing contradictory or duplicate actions.

User Impact
- Confusing UX and inconsistent history; users can create multiple SKIPPED entries or snooze a dose that’s already skipped.

Where This Likely Needs Changes
- Timeline action dialog button enablement:
  - File: app/src/main/java/com/medreminder/app/ui/TimelineView.kt (action dialog around Snooze/Skip buttons)
  - The code already computes history for today and whether there’s history for this time. You can check for an existing SKIPPED entry and disable Snooze/Skip accordingly.
- Broadcast handlers already record SKIPPED and remove pending:
  - File: app/src/main/java/com/medreminder/app/notifications/ReminderBroadcastReceiver.kt (handleSkip)

Proposed Resolution
- In TimelineView’s action dialog, determine status for the specific occurrence using today’s History:
  - If there exists a History entry for (medicationId, scheduledTime day+hour+minute) with action="SKIPPED":
    - Disable or hide Snooze and Skip buttons.
    - Optionally keep Taken enabled to allow correction.
- Apply the same rule anywhere else the action palette is shown (e.g., TakeMedicationsScreen, OutstandingMedicationsScreen) for consistency.

Acceptance Criteria
- After marking a dose SKIPPED, re-opening the action dialog for the same medication/time shows Snooze and Skip as disabled (or hidden).
- No duplicate SKIPPED entries can be created for the same medication/time via Timeline dialog.
- If Taken is allowed post-skip, pressing Taken replaces or coexists per product decision (out of scope here but should be tested).

Notes
- TimelineView already computes a per-slot `hasHistoryForThisTime`; extend this to inspect `action == "SKIPPED"` and wire that to button enabled states.
- Consider the same-day boundary and the exact match check (day+hour+minute) as used elsewhere (`isSameScheduledTime`).
